* TML Introduction : HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It gives structure to the content on the internet. HTML tells the browser what to display and how to arrange text, images, links, tables, and other elements. It is the foundation of every website.

* HTML Elements : An HTML element usually has a start tag, content, and an end tag. Some elements are self-closing like `<br>` and `<img>`. Each element has a specific purpose, such as displaying text, images, or creating sections.

* Nested HTML Elements : Nested elements are elements placed inside other elements. Proper nesting means closing tags in the correct order. This helps the browser understand the structure clearly.

* HTML Attributes : Attributes provide additional information about elements. They are written in the opening tag and usually come in name="value" format. Attributes control links, images, styles, form behavior, and more.

* HTML Headings : Headings define titles and subheadings. `<h1>` is the most important heading and is usually used for the main title. Headings help organize content and improve SEO.

* HTML Paragraphs : Paragraphs are written using the `<p>` tag. They are used for normal text content. Browsers automatically add spacing to make paragraphs easy to read.

* HTML Styles : The `style` attribute is used to apply CSS directly to an element. It can change color, size, font, alignment, border, and background.

* HTML Text Formatting : Formatting tags make text bold, italic, important, or highlighted. `<strong>` and `<em>` give meaning, while `<b>` and `<i>` only change appearance.

* HTML Quotation : Quotation elements display quoted text properly. `<blockquote>` creates a separate block for long quotes. `<q>` is used inside a sentence for short quotes.

* HTML Comments : Comments are written to explain the code or temporarily disable parts of it. They are not shown in the browser and help developers understand the code.

* HTML Colors : Colors can be applied to text, borders, and backgrounds. They improve design and user experience. Colors can be written as names, HEX, RGB, or HSL values.

* HTML CSS (Styles) : CSS is used to design web pages. Inline CSS affects one element, internal CSS affects one page, and external CSS affects multiple pages.

* HTML Links : Links are created with the `<a>` tag. They allow navigation between pages, websites, or sections. Links can also open emails or phone calls.

* HTML Images : Images are inserted using `<img>`. The `alt` attribute helps screen readers and shows text if the image does not load.

* HTML Favicon : A favicon is a small image shown in the browser tab. It helps identify the website easily.

* HTML Page Title  : The `<title>` tag defines the page name in the browser tab. It is important for search engines and bookmarks.

* HTML Tables : Tables organize data into rows and columns. They are useful for showing structured information like marks, prices, or schedules.

* HTML Lists : Lists organize items clearly. Ordered lists use numbers, unordered lists use bullet points, and description lists explain terms.

* HTML Block and Inline Elements** : Block elements take full width and start on a new line. Inline elements only take the space they need and stay in the same line.

* HTML Div Element : The `<div>` element is used to group content and create sections. It is commonly used with CSS for layout design.

* HTML Class : The `class` attribute allows multiple elements to share the same style or behavior.

* HTML Id Attribute : The `id` attribute gives a unique identity to an element. It is useful for styling, linking, and JavaScript functions.

* HTML Buttons : Buttons are interactive elements created using `<button>`. They can submit forms or perform actions using JavaScript.

* HTML Iframes : An `<iframe>` displays another webpage, video, or map inside your webpage.

* HTML JavaScript : JavaScript adds interactivity to websites. It can change content, validate forms, create animations, and respond to user actions.

* HTML File Paths : File paths tell the browser where files are stored. Relative paths are used within the project folder, and absolute paths use full website URLs.

* HTML Head Element : The `<head>` section contains metadata like title, styles, scripts, and character encoding. It helps the browser understand the webpage.

* HTML Layout : Layout elements structure the webpage into header, navigation, content, sidebar, and footer sections.

* HTML Responsive : Responsive design ensures that webpages adjust automatically to different screen sizes using CSS and viewport settings.

* HTML Computer Code Elements : Tags like `<code>`, `<pre>`, `<kbd>`, `<samp>`, and `<var>` are used to display programming code and keyboard input clearly.

* HTML Semantic Elements : Semantic elements clearly describe their meaning, making the webpage more readable and better for search engines.

* HTML Style Guide : A style guide keeps HTML code clean and consistent by using lowercase tags, proper indentation, and meaningful names.

* HTML Entities : Entities display special characters that have reserved meanings in HTML, such as `<`, `>`, and `&`.

* HTML Symbols : Symbols like ©, ™, €, and ✓ can be displayed using special entity codes.

* HTML Forms : Forms collect user data such as name, email, and password. Data is usually sent to a server for processing.

* HTML Form Attributes : Attributes like `action`, `method`, and `autocomplete` control how the form behaves.

* HTML Form Elements : Form elements collect different types of user input like text, numbers, selections, and files.

* HTML Input Types : Input types like text, password, email, number, date, radio, checkbox, and submit allow different kinds of user input.
